The app doesn't ask about any location permission but it uses the location and location manager classes

### Privacy Policy
Once you opt-in and enable exposure notifications on your phone, Covid Watch starts working immediately to detect if you come into close proximity with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. The app is completely anonymous and works in the background without ever needing to know your location or personal information. Itâ€™s simple, safe, and secure.

### Privacy Violations
The app says it never collects, transmits, or stores personal information, but the app is getting location information via the location manager class which is due to the use of Twilight Manager which takes the device's location to find out the sunset and sunrise times.

### Ghera Vulnerabilities
 - [False Positive] The app is vulnerable to SQL Raw Query SQL Injection Vulnerability (https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-app-vulnerability-benchmarks/src/master/Storage/SQLlite-RawQuery-SQLInjection-Lean/) since it uses rawQuery() to get information. 
 - 
### Deeper Analysis
- Next the app can read/write to external storage which means the app is vulnerable to data injection and if any data is written from the app to the external storage it can be read from any other app.
- The app uses a MD5 hash function which is weak outdated function that should be updated.
- The app uses a SHA-1 hash which is weak and outdated and should be updated to SHA-256.
- [False Postive] Next is the rawQuery SQL vulnerability however while the function is vulnerable the program doesnt allow for opportunities for injection.
- [False Positive] Next is the Insecure Implementation of SSL while this seems vulnerable to MITM attacks the app uses SSL Certificate pinning to detect and prevent MITM attacks. It also doesn't use the getSocket() or getInsecure() methods which are known to be vulnerable to MITM attacks
- The app uses an insecure Random Number Generator. While this isn't too much of a vulnerability the app should be updated to use SecureRandom.
