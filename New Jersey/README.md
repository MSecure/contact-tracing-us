### Summary:

This app uses the Exposure API developed by Apple and Google jointly. If you are within 6 feet of another person with the app for 10 minutes, your phone exchanges a secure Bluetooth token (code) with that person's. Then, if that person gets COVID, you get a notification that you were exposed- because you have their token. There is NO way for this app to see your location. There is NO tracking of your location through the app. It does NOT compromise bluetooth. This app can save lives.

### CODE ANALYSIS
- The App uses an insecure Random Number Generator, java.util.Random. This should be replaced by java.secure.SecureRandom instead.
- [*False Positive*] ~~Files may contain hardcoded sensitive information like usernames, passwords, keys etc~~. After manually checked all the file containing this warning, the hardcoded information are only normal constants; no hardcoded password exists.
- IP Address disclosure?
- [*False Positive*] ~~	App uses SQLite Database and execute raw SQL query. Untrusted user input in raw SQL queries can cause SQL Injection. Also sensitive information should be encrypted and written to the database.~~
- App can read/write to External Storage. Any App can read data written to External Storage. ` Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()` to create new file in obb folder `h/a/a/a/a/a.java`. An . obb file is an expansion file used by some Android apps distributed using the Google Play store. It contains data not stored in the applicationâ€™s main package (. APK file), such as graphics, media files, and other large program assets.

- Uses the vulnerable SHA-1 hash function which should be replaced with a more secure SHA-256 hash
- Accessing websites which use or direct to HTTP connections, which are outdated compared to the more secure HTTPS connections
- Reads/writes to external storage, leaving it vulnerable to data injection
