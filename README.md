# Analysis of contact tracing Android apps in the US

The repository contains information about security and privacy of official contact tracing developed and deployed by states in the US. The apps were statically analyzed using a variety of tools such as MobSF and Androguard. Here we record the raw reports generated by statically analyzing the apps. Further, we also record our observations based on the analysis results.

## How to navigate the repository

- Each directory corresponds to an app's package name that was considered for analysis.
- Each directory, has a README file with observations about the following:
  - Requested app permissions.
  - Device features used by the app (e.g., bluetooth, location, phone, networking, etc.)
  - Violations of privacy as defined in the app's published privacy policy.
  - Known vulnerabilities in the app as captured in the [Ghera repository](https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-app-vulnerability-benchmarks/src/master/).
- A file called *apk_hash.txt* with the hash value of the apk that was downloaded for the analysis along with other metadata about the app.
- The output generated by tools such as MobSF.

We used the official list of contact tracing apps published by Google [here](https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/apps) as reference.
We considered only the apps in the US:
