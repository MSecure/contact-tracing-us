Analysis of contact tracing Android apps


- For each app you analyze, make a directory with the app's package name
- In each directory, have a txt file with your observations about the following:
  - What permissions does the app request.
  - What device features does the app use (e.g., bluetooth, location, phone, networking, etc.)
  - Does the app violate its own privacy policies and how?
  - Does the app have any known vulnerabilities caputured in the Ghera repository.
- The directory should also have a file called *apk_hash.txt* which should contain the hash value of the apk that you downloaded.
